This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and trying to render items that are not properly defined or have unexpected properties. It's often caused by issues within the data passed to the FlatList's `data` prop.  Here's an example where the `item` in the `renderItem` function is undefined or lacks the expected property `name` causing a TypeError: 

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{id:1}, {id:2, name: 'Item 2'}, null, {id:4}]}
  renderItem={({item}) => (
    <Text>{item.name}</Text> // Error occurs here if item is null or lacks name
  )}
/>
```
